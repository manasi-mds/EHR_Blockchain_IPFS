# EHR_Blockchain_IPFS
## Decentralized Patient Centric e-Health Record Management System using Blockchain and IPFS
Electronic Health Records(EHR) are gaining a lot of popularity all over the world. The current EHR systems however have their fair share of problems related to privacy and security. We have proposed a mechanism which provides a solution to most of these problems by using a permissioned Ethereum blockchain that allows the hospitals and patients across the world to be connected to each other. It gives patients full control over their health records and also allows them to grant or revoke a hospital's access to his/her records. We have used IPFS(inter planetary file system) to store records which has the advantage of being distributed and ensures immutability of records.
